Documentation
=============

See ``REQUIREMENTS`` in the `setup.py <https://github.com/divio/djangocms-picture/blob/master/setup.py>`_
file for additional dependencies:

* Python 2.7, 3.3 or higher
* Django 1.8 or higher

Make sure `django Filer <http://django-filer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_
is installed and configured appropriately.


Installation
------------

For a manual install:

* run ``pip install djangocms-picture``
* add ``djangocms_picture`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
* run ``python manage.py migrate djangocms_picture``


Configuration
-------------

Note that the provided templates are very minimal by design. You are encouraged
to adapt and override them to your project's requirements.

This addon provides a ``default`` template for all instances. You can provide
additional template choices by adding a ``DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_TEMPLATES``
setting, for example::

    DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_TEMPLATES = [
        ('background', _('Background image')),
    ]

In this case, ``background`` is the name of a *directory* that contains the 
template set required.

You'll need to create a ``background`` directory inside ``templates/djangocms_picture/``
otherwise you will get a ``Template does not exist`` error. You can do this by
copying the ``default`` directory that's there already and renaming it to
``background``.

Another setting is ``DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_NESTING``, which allows you to render an image
as the background image of a container that also contains other content (text, icons
and so on).

::

    DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_NESTING = True

will enable this (the default is ``False``). When set to ``True``, you'll be able to place additional
plugins inside the picture plugin. 

You can override alignment styles with ``DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_ALIGN``, for example::

    DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_ALIGN = [
        ('top', _('Top Aligned')),
    ]

This will generate a class prefixed with ``align-``. The example above
would produce a ``class="align-top"``. Adding a ``class`` key to the image
attributes automatically merges the alignment with the attribute class.

You can use ``DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_RATIO`` to set the width/height ratio of images
if these values are not set explicitly on the image::

    DJANGOCMS_PICTURE_RATIO = 1.618

We use the `golden ratio <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_ratio>`_, 
approximately 1.618, as a default value for this.

When working out sizes for the image, the system will use the following values, 
of preference:

* the width or height set in the *Thumbnail options*
* *Autoscale* 
* the *Width* and *Height* 

We recommend setting width or height values around a placeholder so 
when the plugin uses *Autoscale* it can discover them::

    {% with 720 as width and 480 as height %}
        {% placeholder content %}
    {% endwith %}

Further configuration can be managed through
`django Filer <https://django-filer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html>`_.
