# Shufflequotes
ShuffleQuotes is an Open Source API that displays random quotes that can be used for any purpose


## Server Requirements
PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
CodeIgniter version 3.1.9 or newer is recommended.
